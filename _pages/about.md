Welcome to my personal website! 
My name is Zihan Zhao, and I am a PhD candidate in Supply Chain, Operations, and Technology at Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis. I am advised by [Prof. Dennis Zhang](http://denniszhang.org/) and [Prof. Renyu (Philip) Zhang](https://rphilipzhang.github.io/rphilipzhang/).

I am interested in data-driven problems of online platforms. I am deeply fascinated by the potential impact that ML/AI techniques can have on the development and optimization of these platforms.
